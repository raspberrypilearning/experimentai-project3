## Collect song data

This whole stage of the quest is just about listening to music!

Now it's time to collect data on songs. The app you just created in Scratch will help your machine learning model learn about different types of music. You're going to use that app now to **label** the songs you listen to.

The more music you listen to and label, the better your machine learning model will become at picking out music your user will enjoy. So, take your time and listen to lots of music, trying out different genres too!

One thing to remember is that when you use the labelling app, it might eventually start playing you lots of songs you've already heard. That's why it's important to switch up the genre of music you're searching for every now and then to ensure you're getting a variety of songs.

To change the genre, simply click the green flag and enter a new genre. Be sure to try out all the different genres you listed earlier in the quest.

`Create a List` in the `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} menu called `genre list` which contains all the genres you want to search.  

Once you have a list of genres, you can use it to automatically set a random genre each time the application searches the music database.  

When you set the genre for your search in your main script, you can use this combination of blocks to instead to set a random genre from your list:
